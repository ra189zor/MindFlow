crewai

# LLM & LangChain Components
openai  # Direct OpenAI client and potentially for specific error types
langchain # Core LangChain library (might be a dependency, but good to list explicitly)
langchain-community # For community tools like DuckDuckGoSearchRun
langchain-openai # For the OpenAI LLM integration with LangChain/CrewAI

# Vector Store (Keep if you plan to use chroma_setup.py)
chromadb

# Utilities
python-dotenv # For loading .env files
tenacity # For implementing retry logic

# LLM Management (Often a dependency of CrewAI, but explicit listing is safer for exception handling)
